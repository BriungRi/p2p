Running the Program:

`java p2p`

Additional Notes:

These notes refer to the Java class EnvironmentVariables
in the `env` package

The file config_sharing.txt contains all the shared files 
with corresponding peer numbers. In order to differentiate,
there is a variable `PEER_NUM` in the environment variables
that specifies the peer's number

The environment variable `DEBUG` is only used to
switch between using user input for the peer port number
or using the `PORT` environment variable
